## Blood Donation Management System

This is a web application that enables users to manage blood donations. It has features that allow users to register and log in, as well as create, update, and delete their own donation records. An administrator has separate access to a dashboard that displays donor details stored in the MongoDB database and allows them to input blood donation details such as amount and remarks.

## Features

User registration and login: Users can create accounts and log in to access the system.
Donor details management: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own donor details.
Donation records management: Users can create, read, and delete their donation records.
Password hashing: The system provides password hashing for user security.

## Technologies Used

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable network applications.
Express.js: A Node.js web application framework that provides features for building web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document-based database used to store and retrieve data.

## Future Improvements

Make user profile viewable in the homepage.
Search function: Add a search function for the donor dashboard to enable users to search for donor details.
Calendar system: Implement a calendar system that allows donors to select dates for their donations and is also viewable on the administrator's dashboard.
